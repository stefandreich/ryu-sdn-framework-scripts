# ryu-sdn-framework-scripts
Basic software-defined networking scripts based on RYU controller framework.
These scripts are working along with Mininet scripts, which creates topologies.

How to run these scripts:

```$ sudo pip3 install ryu  # install ryu if it's not already installed```
<br>
```$ ryu-manager <script file name>```

As I said above, this must be used with topologies. Otherwise, it will not work.
